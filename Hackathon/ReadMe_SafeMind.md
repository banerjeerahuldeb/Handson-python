What to showcase in screenshots

KPI cards: High-Risk Assets, Avg Risk, Open SN Tickets, Preventive WOs.

🔥 Safety Risk Heatmap: toggle “Show High Risk only (≥ 0.7)” to highlight red tiles.

📋 High-Risk Queue: shows each asset with a progress bar risk score and latest telemetry (vibration, temp, overdue days, recent SN incidents).

Use the built-in scenario: Boiler Feed Pump – 2A fixed at 78% risk.

Click Create SN Ticket, Create Preventive WO, Attach SOP to show success toasts (no real calls made).

🔎 Asset Spotlight: pick any asset to show recent readings in a table.

🧩 Guardrail Details: shows Input/Output guardrails, Confidence, and Human-in-the-loop badges with a short explainer.

If you want this to look more brand-ready (colors/fonts/logo) or need a second view (e.g., “Compliance Audit Log” page) for additional screenshots, say the word and I’ll extend the app.
